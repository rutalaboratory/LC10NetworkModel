### LC10a Spiking Network Model

Sample code for simulating the LC10a network model in Hindmarsh Sten et al., 2021. 

There exists two variants of this model, one tailed for simulating tethered courtship behavior, and the other for simulating the turning behavior of freely courting males given the relative position of the female target. In each case, sample behavioral and stimulus data is provided.
